              <h2>Taiwan Detects Record 66 Chinese Aircraft Around Island In 24 Hours</h2>
              <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-08/2f9gk8ro_taiwan-china-afp_625x300_09_August_22.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=650,height=400" alt="Image 1">
              <p>
                Taiwan's defence ministry said Thursday it had detected 66 Chinese military aircraft around the island in a 24-hour window, a record-high this year, a day after it said Beijing was conducting exercises in nearby waters.
China -- which maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan -- claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory and has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring it under its control.

Thursday's record comes a day after Taipei spotted Chinese aircraft around the island that it said were headed to the western Pacific for exercises with the PLA aircraft carrier Shandong.

"66 PLA aircraft and seven PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (2200 GMT Wednesday) today," the defence ministry said in Thursday's statement, adding it has "responded accordingly".

Fifty-six of the Chinese aircraft crossed the sensitive median line bisecting the Taiwan Strait -- a narrow 180-kilometre (110-mile) waterway separating the island from China.

              <p>Technologically proficient con artists now have an easier time targeting victims as the age of machine learning and artificial intelligence infiltrate every part of people's lives, both personal and professional. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting smartphone users nationwide because of the many false calls and texts they get. Scammers even create fake websites, tricking unsuspecting users with graphics.
                The Indian government's cyber agency, Cyberdost, has sent a warning regarding a new fraud that targets iPhone users exclusively. As per Cyberdost, messages are being sent over iMessage to iPhone users informing them that a wrong address is preventing a package from being delivered.

Cyberdost's tweet states: "New Transnational #Scam Alert: #iPhone users are learnt to be receiving scam messages via #iMessage regarding package / courier from random accounts. Clicking on suspicious links may be avoided and read receipts may be disabled for such messages."

              <p>The International Space Station (ISS), a remarkable feat of human engineering and international collaboration, has been orbiting Earth for 25 years. Here are ten fascinating facts about this cosmic outpost:
                Size and Weight: The ISS, akin to a mini-city in space, weighs a staggering 419 tonnes and spans the length of a football field, measuring 109 meters end to end.
                
                Scientific Hub: It serves primarily as a research laboratory where scientists from around the world conduct experiments in microgravity conditions, invaluable for advancements in biology, physics, astronomy, and materials science.
                Costly Endeavor: Constructing and maintaining the ISS has been a monumental financial effort, surpassing $150 billion since its inception.

                Operational Dynamics: Circling the Earth at an astounding speed of 28,165.00 kilometers per hour, the ISS completes 16 orbits daily, providing astronauts aboard with 16 sunrises and sunsets within 24 hours.</p>

              <p>Protests against the NEET exams - over allegations of leaked question papers and preferential marking - have led to a bitter political row, particularly in Bihar, where four men told police the paper was leaked a day before the exam.
                The four have been identified as NEET candidate Anurag Yadav, his uncle Sikandar Yadavendu, and two others - Nitish Kumar and Amit Anand. Mr Yadav said his uncle gave him the leaked paper - which "had the same questions (as) in the exam" - a day in advance.  The uncle told the cops Mr Kumar and Mr Anand offered the paper - which sorts students for admission to medical courses - for ₹ 32 lakh.
                Bihar Police's Economic Offences Wing is, for now, handling all inquiries, and has recovered post-dated cheques that may have been issued to accused who demanded over ₹ 30 lakh from each candidate.

              <p>Delhi, which endured one of the worst heatwaves in history earlier this month, now faces severe water-logging with record-breaking rainfall in just 24 hours, surpassing the city's average for the entire month of June.
                According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Safdarjung observatory in the city recorded 228mm of rainfall ending at 8:30 am today. It marks the second-highest 24-hour rainfall in June ever recorded. The city had on June 28, 1936 recorded 235.5mm rainfall.
                
                The IMD, which defines very heavy rain as rainfall amounting to between 124.5 and 244.4 mm in a day, said later in the morning that the monsoon has arrived. The rain began around 3 am.
                
                The downpour caused a fatal airport roof collapse, disrupted flights, blocked underpasses, and nightmarish mega traffic jams, turning the city's relief from the heat into chaos.
                
                "You have to understand that if Delhi receives rainfall of 228 mm, then it will take time to decrease the water level... Right now, Delhi has received more rainfall than the capacity of the drains. That's why we are witnessing waterlogging at several places...," said Atishi, Delhi's Water Minister, whose own house was flooded.</p>

                Officials added that rescue teams faced significant obstacles in reaching areas targeted by attacks due to fuel shortages and intense clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed factions, particularly in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza and the Shujaeya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City, Xinhua news agency reported.
                
                Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesperson, said in a press statement on Saturday that the Israeli forces are continuing the attack on "terrorist" targets in the Shujaeya area, fighting simultaneously above and below ground.</p>
