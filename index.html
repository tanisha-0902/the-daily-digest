   <div class="content">
    <i>
        <h3 style="color: beige;">
            Stay informed:  The news keeps you updated on current events, local happenings, and global issues.
            <br>
             This allows you to be aware of what's going on in the world around you and participate in informed conversations.

Understand the world around you:  News provides context for events and helps you connect the dots between seemingly disparate issues.
<br>
 Reading news articles from various sources can expose you to different perspectives and foster a more nuanced understanding of the world.

Develop critical thinking skills:  News articles often present various viewpoints and arguments. 
<br>
 As you read, you'll be challenged to analyze information, identify biases, and form your own opinions. This critical thinking skill is valuable in all aspects of life.

Become a more engaged citizen:  Staying informed about current events allows you to participate actively in your community and democracy. 
<br>
You can make informed decisions about voting, support causes you believe in, and hold your elected officials accountable.
